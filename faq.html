                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">How are parent and student profiles verified?</button>
                <p> When students sign up, they are required to use their school emails and information the school has on file for them. Furthermore, they are requried to connect a social media profile to see if they are a real person and if they have a similar network of friends to the other people in the school community.</p>
                <p> Adult profiles will be verified in three levels. Their information will be verified with the information the school has on file about them, they will be required to link their social network profiles, and they will be asked to submit a picture of a government issued ID for verification. </p>

                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">As a parent, how do I post a job offering?</button>
                <p> After completing the sign up process, posting a job offereing is quite simple and easy. On the Parent Profile, there is a link that says 'Post A Job.' Just click on the link and you will be carefully guided through each step to post a job offering. StuWork has made sure the process is easy enough that you can have a job posted in just 60 seconds!</p>

                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">As a student, how do I apply for a job?</button>
                <p> On the Student Profile page, each student lists what skills they have and jobs that they can complete. Upon completing this list, the sutdent can click the 'Find a Job' button. The student will be taken to a list of job offerings, all of which adhere to the list created on their profile page. To actually apply for a specific job, the student clicks on the job offering and then selects the 'Apply' link. Here the student enters a message, and their profile is linked to the job offering when they finsh the process. The parent can then view their message and the students profile to make an informed decision. It's that easy! </p>

                <p> If a student cancels before three days of the job, the job offer is recycled throught the system. If the student cancels less than three days in advance or misses the job, the student will be suspended from the system. </p>
