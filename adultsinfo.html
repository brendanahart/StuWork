                <p> Working is one thing; however, getting all the house chores done, taking care of loved ones, and doing miscellaneous tasks and odd jobs are a whole other world. These are all jobs that need to get done, but usually adults do not have the time or will to do them. This is where StuWork comes in. StuWork provides adults with motivated high school workers who are apart of your school community (whether you are a parent, faculty member, or alumni). They are willing to do these types of jobs for less than a professional service in exchange for the same, if not more, quality for the jobs done.</p>

                <p> StuWork tries to build a community around the jobs being done so there can be a certian level of trust and accountability with the jobs being done.

This leads to trust that they will get the job done to your expectation. </p>
