                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">Earn Money</button>
                <p> Most students rely on their parents for money if they want to make any purchases, which subsequently makes them reliant on their parents expenses. Break free with StuWork as any student has the potential to make their own money and support thier own spending habits. It's a simple and easy way for students to experience working and managing finances at the same time, all while having the fun that comes with being a high school student </p>

                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">Work with Familiar People</button>
                <p> The StuWork enviornment is centered entirely on a school community. Trustworthiness is key when working for and hiring someone. By working with parents and alumni of the school, it allows a sense of trust to be instilled in each party, as opposed to wroking with a complete stranger. Furthermore, StuWork does their best to verify each and every potential person you are working for, so you know you are in safe hands when you do work for them. </p>

                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">On Your Time</button>
                <p> There are a multitude of reasons why students are not employed, the most common of which is that it is a huge time commitment for a student to balance work, sports, academics, and fun. 37% of MICDS high school students say that they are not employed because of the time commitment issues. Because students are contracted for one specific job which are mostly a couple hours at a time, they will not have to work long hours for a minimum wage paycheck. </p>

                <button type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-lg">Gamification</button>
                <p> In order to make doing these jobs more fun, StuWork employs a gamification system that can be used to compete against your friends and see how far you have come as a Stuworker. Each student has a ranking, which tells them and others how many jobs he/she has done and how well they have done them. In order to achieve the next rank, a sutdent must complete five additional jobs, with a rating of B+ or higher in each of those jobs. May the force be with you! </p>

                <p> By doing jobs like tutoring, babysitting, and yard work, students gain valuable work skills like responsiblity, time management, and communication. Theses skills translate directly to college as StuWork will try to market the jobs that students have done to colleges in hopes that they recognize the work that students have done and the skills they have developed. </p>
